# PNA.M (*Personalised News App by Marcel*)
Imagine an app where:  
- You **don't have to juggle 10 news sites** to stay updated  
- You **never miss a story** on your interests, no matter how niche  
- The feed **cuts through the clutter.** No clickbait, no duplicates, just what *you* care about
  
PNA.M is for people who want to stay informed on specific topics without the hassle of jumping between apps or drowning in irrelevant stories. It pulls news from multiple sources into one clean, personalized feed. You choose the topics, and the app brings the updates. No digging, no clicking around.
Itâ€™s built on a simple idea: if the news matters, it should come to you, without friction.
